# Shopping List Project (August 2020)

The objective of this project is to build a simple shopping list that allows you to keep track of your shopping cart.

## Specifications

For a project to be considered finished the following user stories must be implemented:

* A user can add a new item in their shopping list
* A user can remove an item from their shopping list
* A user must be able to clear their shopping list

Nice to have:

* A user can edit the amount of an item in their shopping list
* A user can set a product as purchased

Advanced features (just to push your limits):

* A user can search for products (pre-defined in the frontend code)
* A user can save their shopping lists to use in a later date
* A user can see an image for each product

Also you can:

* Create a backend and move any functionality that you think that better fits there (product retrieval, search, images, etc)
* Create mind-blowing UI with a great user experience

## Language/Framework/Technologies

You are allowed to use any programming language, framework and technology that you may like, as long as these tools don't forbid you to host your code in a public Github repository.

## Submissions

**IMPORTANT**: For a submission to be considered valid, you have to provide at least one screenshot of your project. You also have to submit the public Github URL of the repository that hosts the project. It will be great if you can host your solution to a free service like Github Pages, or Heroku if you have a backend.

Please submit your project by following our Instagram page and sending us a private message through Instagram's chat. As mentioned above, all GitHub profiles with a valid submission will be mentioned at the end of this file.
